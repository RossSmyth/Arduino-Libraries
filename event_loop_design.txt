Events and coroutines:

Every coroutine will return an event.
Events are actually integers the corrsepond to a compile-time array of function pointers
They can return themselves
They will return INT_MAX once per lifetime, which signifies their state has been reset and the coroutine is "finished"
Coroutine state is stored in static variables in the function and global variables
The event loop is seperate from the "real" program loop, but is called each loop if the queue has items
Interrupt routines can add events to the event queue
There shall be an array of function pointers
The length of the array = number of events for the program
Event ID = index in array
